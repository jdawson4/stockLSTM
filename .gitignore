# ignore datasets--they're way too big to put on github haha
#*.json
# eh screw it, what if we upload it anyway?

# we also don't want to be uploading model weights:
*.h5

# we also don't want to save the whole folder containing
# the LSTM as it exists:
single_output_lstm/
stock_lstm/

# we simply don't need the pycache:
__pycache__/
